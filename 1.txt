Run this code with python3, to install and run use the following commands:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 fibonacci.py


Note: change the value stored inside [processing].[digits] in the config.ini file in order
to test different scenarios


At the end you will get a chart that will show you the distribution of the needed time after each step
and the over all consumed time like:

index:  4782  - digits:  1000
Fibonacci index search took 2661.959 ms


[Please take note]: I've tried other 2 algorithms and in terms of performance the one implemented in the
fibonaci.py file is the best

1) recursion +memorization [the best one and the one I've implemented]
2) Swap variables method [not good enough for high numbers of digits] but better than -3
3) recursion without memorization [very slow]
